This repository serves as the base repository for use in a Software Carpentry Workshop 
to show an example workflow for collaborating on a project. The lesson plan is under
development and will be linked when complete. 


#### Countries Collaboration

We have a set of markdown files representing the countries of the world. We invite you
to share facts about these countries. If you would like to work on a country, please
open an issue to let us know on which country you are working.
